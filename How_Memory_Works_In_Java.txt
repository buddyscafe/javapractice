String Pool:
============

The place where the java vm, stores the string objects created through String literals.
Ex: 
String x = "Test"; //This Object will be store in String Pool
String y = "Test";
check if(x == y) { "both are same object"}

String a = new Integer(76).toString(); // This won't be stored in String Pool and will be stored in Heap Only
String b = "76";

Check if(a == b) { "Both objects aren't equal" }

String p = new Integer(76).toString().intern(); // This will be stored in String Pool instead of Heap
String q = "76";

Check if(p == q) { "Both objects are equal" }

Garbage Collection Eligibility:
===============================

If an object in the heap isn't reachable from any reference in the stack, It is considered as garbage.
Note: An Object eligible for garbage collection might have references or may be referenced by another object in the heap. 

gc() and finalize():
====================
gc() shouldn't be called explicitly, as it doesn't provide guaranteed execution of the garbage collection.
No use of calling gc() or finalise(), As it is never certain that they will run. 
No operation can be performed on the basis of execution of these two methods.

Detecting Soft leaks:
=====================
Soft leak: An Object available in the Heap Memory which will never be used again but still has a reference in the stack, hence won't be garbage collected.
Detect Soft leak: To Identify the Soft leaks in memory, Need to analyze the code performance by monitoring the heap memory usage using some tool like JVisualM (JDK/bin/JVisualM.exe).


Garbage Collection:
===================
1. Mark and sweep: Default algorithm used by garbage collector in java.
Behaviour: Garbage collector marks all the active references in the heap and then free the space by runing the sweep process over un marked objects.
Tradeoff: In general, at a time, there are very less no of objects having active references in Heap as compared to unreferenced ones. So marking all the active referenced object would be faster than marking unreferenced ones, hence this algorithm provides qicker garbage collection in such cases.
2. Generational Garbage Collection:
